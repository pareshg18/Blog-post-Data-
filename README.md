# Blog-post-Data

Performed Least Square Regression, Ridge regression and Lasso regression on the blog feedback data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/BlogFeedback) to predict the number of comments a post will recieve.

Used Lasso regression to find out the most important features from a set of 280 features.
